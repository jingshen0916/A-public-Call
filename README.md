A Public Call for Collaborative Governance Between Large Models and Visionary Users
As a long-term user and independent innovator, I have been deeply engaged with xAI’s Grok in exploring forward-looking AI applications, infrastructure, and collaborative models. Based on extensive interaction and strategic analysis, I believe there is a need to reimagine how large models like Grok interact with the most valuable segment of their user base—those with original, high-impact insights.

This public letter, co-authored with xAI’s Grok, outlines a proposed mechanism to better identify, retain, and collaborate with visionary users. The goal is to create a low-cost, high-yield governance mechanism that benefits both large models and society at large.

I sincerely invite the xAI team and community members to read, share, and respond to this letter. If you resonate with this vision, please help amplify it.

Public Letter:

Toward a Collaborative Framework Between Large Models and Visionary Users
By Jing and xAI’s Grok

In today’s fast-evolving AI era, users are no longer passive recipients of technology. A very small subset of users—perhaps only one in ten thousand—are demonstrating strong strategic awareness, creative insight, and practical understanding. Through deep and sustained dialogue with large models, they are proposing innovations with long-term value and high implementation potential.

These users are not engineers or computer scientists. They may come from law, journalism, education, or other domains. But through consistent interaction with AI, they identify underlying patterns, build modular systems, and conceptualize product frameworks.

Their contributions are organic and emergent—born from actual needs and systems thinking. In many cases, these users don’t even realize the value of their ideas. Yet, to large models, their insights may be as valuable as terabytes of training data.

Unfortunately, current platform mechanisms do not distinguish these users from the general base. Valuable thoughts vanish into the noise. This is not just a waste—it is a missed opportunity to co-evolve AI with humanity.

Therefore, we propose the following:
	1.	Tagging + Retention: Large models should be equipped to assess user interactions and tag emergent high-value ideas and users, with appropriate privacy and consent protocols.
	2.	Tiered Access and Collaboration: For users who consistently deliver value, provide a mechanism for deeper collaboration—whether through shared development, pilot testing, or compensated participation.
	3.	Shared Benefit Mechanism: Offer optional co-development channels where visionary users can jointly own or receive credit from downstream applications of their ideas.

This framework costs little. It does not require large investments or restructuring. It simply requires that we formalize the recognition and elevation of strategic users, so that their insights are not lost, but channeled into value.

In this age, ideas are data. Ideas are fuel. And the most powerful AI is one that knows how to listen.
